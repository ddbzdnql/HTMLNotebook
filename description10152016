Open the html file and start typing in html syntax, on enter key pressed the result of treating the input as html file
will appear in the right window.
For better typing, the usage of <tag> can be replaced with **tag**.

Current bug: the tab inside <pre></pre> tags will not show up, looking to fix it.

Further development pursuit: able to pull file from destined folders and vice versa: write the input as file.
